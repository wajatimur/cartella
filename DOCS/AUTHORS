Several icons in the "default" DocMGR theme were taken from
Redhat's Bluecurve Gnome Desktop theme.  In addition, all
of the mime-type thumbnail icons came from the KDE Cezanne Icone Theme.
This theme was created by Chris Townson, and can be downloaded
from http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=16479.
